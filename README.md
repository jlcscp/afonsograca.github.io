This is my personal website. It is built and tested in Chrome, Firefox and Safari. Support for Opera and IE was implemented though.

The main goal of this project was to develop a website with the most basic tools (i.e. text editor, HTML, CSS and Javascript - JQuery). No jQuery plugins were used. HTML5 and CSS3 are used throughout the code. The website uses flexbox to provide a fluid interface, so the website adapts to different web browser sizes and devices.

Feel free to browse the code and make recommendations, suggestions and critiques.
